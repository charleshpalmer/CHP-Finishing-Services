To replace the damaged panel would cost many thousands not to mention the time it would take. So you can imagine how delighted the owner was to learn of CHP Finishing Services Ltd, so without delay the repair was underway and within a day the yacht was back to its former glory and at a fraction of the panel replacement cost, the owner delighted.",
